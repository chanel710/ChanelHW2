Bootstrap Homework 
I created an interactive portfolio website containing general professional information. On the first page you 
will see general information “About Me”, my profile picture and two button links. These two buttons will lead to 
my LinkedIn account and my resume’. I provided a jumbotron from Bootstrap for design effects and a card at the 
bottom for some quick information. The navigation bar will lead to my portfolio which includes some pictures
 and the same two links are easily accessible again to LinkedIn and to my resume’. The third page will allow 
 the person to submit their contact information for further communication. All pages have Bootstrap elements 
 for placement and style. Each section was able to be style within HTML provided while adjusting the column and 
 rows following the grid method.
